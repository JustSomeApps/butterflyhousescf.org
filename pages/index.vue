                <p>
                    <strong>Our mission is to provide a safe, sober residence for women in recovery from alcohol or other drug dependency skills, peer-to-peer fellowship and support, and educational experiences that will aid them in the transition back into their families and communities.</strong>

                    <strong>What is a Sober House?</strong>
                    A Sober House provides an alcohol-free and drug-free living environment for people in recovery. A sober promotes recovery from addiction by requiring that residents follow house and societal rules, attend 12 step meetings regularly and submit to random drug and alcohol screening. A sober house provides structure for the recovering alcoholic or addict by enforcing curfews, requiring that they be in school or employed and be involved in outpatient treatment or counseling.

                <p>Sober house rules generally do not allow overnight guests and have zero tolerance for violence, theft, and use of drugs or alcohol. Consequences for breaking house rules range from a small financial penalty to immediate expulsion from the program, depending on the offense. Living in a sober house with other recovering people gives the opportunity to make new friends that have the same issues and goals as yourself. The idea is that your housemates can offer support and understanding (which is essential to your success in recovery).</p>
                <p>Sober houses provide accountability as well as a "bridge" between inpatient treatment or incarceration and independent living. A good sober house will model living skills which may include goal setting, budgeting, relationship building, parenting, hygiene, cooking/cleaning and employment search. Sober house rules usually required residents to go to bed at a reasonable hour, get up at a certain time and be productive during the day.</p>
                <p>Residents are expected to keep the house and property clean and in good order. When a drug addict or alcoholic gets sober, they may have to change many things about themselves to maintain their sobriety. This could include changing jobs or eliminating unhealthy relationships. Sober housing provides a secure place to adjust to these life changes and helps the recovering addict or alcoholic to gain the strength they will need to re-enter society. Living in a sober house gives the recovering person an opportunity to learn the tools needed to live a productive, law-abiding, healthy, alcohol-free, and drug-free life.</p>
